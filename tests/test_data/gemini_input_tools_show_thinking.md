I am **Gemini**, a large language model built by Google.

I am designed to be a helpful thought partner and can assist you with a wide range of tasks, from writing and coding to learning new subjects and analyzing data.

How can I help you today?

What is the cut-off day for your data?

Based on the current model versions available as of **December 2025**, my knowledge cutoff date depends on the specific version of the Gemini model being used:

*   **Gemini 3.0 & 2.5 Series (Pro/Flash):** The knowledge cutoff is **January 2025**.
    
*   **Gemini 2.0 Flash:** The knowledge cutoff is **August 2024** (some sources cite November 2024).
    
*   **Gemini 1.5 Pro:** The knowledge cutoff is **November 2023**.

However, as a Gemini model, I use Google Search to provide you with current, real-time information that goes beyond this training cutoff date.
