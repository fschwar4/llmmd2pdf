Conversation with Gemini
========================

What Model are you?


I am **Gemini**, a large language model built by Google.

I am designed to be a helpful thought partner and can assist you with a wide range of tasks, from writing and coding to learning new subjects and analyzing data.

How can I help you today?

What is the cut-off day for your data?


Based on the current model versions available as of **December 2025**, my knowledge cutoff date depends on the specific version of the Gemini model being used:

*   **Gemini 3.0 & 2.5 Series (Pro/Flash):** The knowledge cutoff is **January 2025**.
    
*   **Gemini 2.0 Flash:** The knowledge cutoff is **August 2024** (some sources cite November 2024).
    
*   **Gemini 1.5 Pro:** The knowledge cutoff is **November 2023**.
    

### **Important Notes:**

*   **Web Access:** Regardless of the hard training cutoff, I can process information from the real world (like today's date, Friday, December 5, 2025) if I have access to Google Search tools or if you provide the data in our chat.
    
*   **Context Window:** I can process vast amounts of new information (documents, code, videos) that you upload, effectively updating my "knowledge" for the duration of our conversation.
    

Would you like to know which specific version you are currently interacting with?

Fast answer data cutoff

The knowledge cutoff date varies by the specific Gemini model version:

*   **January 2025:** For the latest models, including **Gemini 3 Pro**, **Gemini 2.5 Pro**, and **Gemini 2.5 Flash**.
    
*   **November 2024:** For **Gemini 2.0 Flash**.
    
*   **November 2023:** For older versions like **Gemini 1.5 Pro**.
    

However, as a Gemini model, I use Google Search to provide you with current, real-time information that goes beyond this training cutoff date.
